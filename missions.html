      <h4><u>Our Mission Verse</u></h4>
      <p class="missionPage">Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, many displaced families have come to our city. Currently, we stay in contact with over 120 refugee children. These children have the chance to attend Sunday school and teens club and we want to offer them one more opportunity to see Jesus.<br><br>No one is doing anything like this for these children in our town. Although, we see this need and we want to fulfill it!<br><br>After all, Christmas is about the gift of Jesus. We want to spend this day with refugee children to make it one they will learn is about the birth of Jesus Christ. Children are going to have some fun, hear the Christmas story, and receive presents. Many of them have lost everything as well as hope for life as they flee into our town. These presents will show them they are loved, and in turn, open relationships to the feeling and meaning of love, Jesus.<br><br>We invite you to become a part of this mission by:<br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Joining in prayer for the children and organizations</li>
        <li>Supporting this mission financially</li>
      </ul>
